Before we get into this particular case, let's make something clear up front: **throughout this course, we're going to be linking you to sources that are "problematic"** (using this word in the social justice sense, meaning "oppressive", "not overtly anti-oppressive", "canceled" or otherwise imperfect).

It would be easy to judge that _most of the links will meet that description_. We could even argue, if we wanted, that literally any source, any publication, any author, any etc., is problematic. Maybe we'll do that later.

For now, we just want to let you know up front that we wouldn't be linking you to most of the things we do if we were following the dogma. It would be forbidden. And yet here we are, linking away.

Our rationale for sharing a link here or not: if it can serve as a stepping stone on the path toward equity, if it can make us more effective, or if it can shed light on an idea we might need to find that path.
