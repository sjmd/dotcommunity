With our "real community" definition in mind, and knowing how easily one tweet can ruin your life, creating real community is a long shot. 

And creating it, and sustaining it, while talking about social justice dogma -- or any hot-button, volatile issue -- is nigh impossible.

But if we can find a way to work "nigh" into a sentence in 2019, we can find a way to create authentic connection and interdependence.

**In the rest of this Module "Dot-Com-Munity", we'll be elaborating on how things blow up online, how to protect yourself (and ourselves), some of the forces at play, and some counter-forces we can apply.**

We'll be applying these lessons to all community formation -- not _just_ online. But we're starting with online, because that's where we are right now, and because this is where so many conversations about social justice happen (and fail).
